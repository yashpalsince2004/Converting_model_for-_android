```

If the script supports arguments, list them here. For example:
| Argument            | Description                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `--input`           | Path to the input model file   |
| `--output`          | Path where the converted model will be saved |
| `--format`          | Target format (`onnx`, `pb`, etc.) |

Example:
